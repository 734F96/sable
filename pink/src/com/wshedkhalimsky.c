\brief watershed transformation in Khalimsky space (inter pixel watershed)

<B>Usage:</B> watershed in mark {bgmark|null} {roi|null} out

<B>Description:</B>
Performs the watershed transformation on the image <B>in.pgm</B>, taking the
set of markers in <B>mark.pgm</B>. 
If this parameter is present, <B>bgmark.pgm</B>
is used as a set of markers for the background.
If this parameter is present, <B>roi</B>
indicates the region of interest on which the operation is performed.
All images must be previously transformed in the khalimsky space with a max strategy.
The output image is in khalimsky space too.

<B>Types supported:</B> byte 2d

<B>Category:</B> connect orders
\ingroup connect orders
